**CONSTRUCTORS**

A constructor is a special type of method of a class.
The name of the constructor method is same as that of class name.
A constructor must have no explicit return type.
A constructor is used to initialize the member data of an object.
A constructor is called when an instance of the class is created.
Every time an object is created for a class using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.


**Two types of constructor**
# Default Constructor
# Parameteriszed Constructor

If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default.
